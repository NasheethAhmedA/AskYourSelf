# AskYourSelf
AskYourSelf is a Flutter app that helps you build introspection habits by asking yourself recurring questions â€” daily, weekly, or monthly. You choose the question types (MCQ, long text, slider, etc.) and reflect with a calendar view of your past answers. Built using Provider, SQLite, and clean Material UI.
